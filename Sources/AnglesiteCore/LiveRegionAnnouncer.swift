/// The single design rule that keeps VoiceOver usable is encoded in the signatures: announcements
/// are a pure function of a *coarse state transition* (`isStreaming` flipping, a deploy reaching a
/// terminal phase, the first stderr line appearing), never of a per-token or per-line append. There
/// is no debounce timer because there is nothing to debounce — the view feeds transitions, and a
/// non-transition returns `nil`.
///
/// The caller (the view) is responsible only for posting a returned string via
/// `AccessibilityNotification.Announcement(_:).post()` from an `.onChange` hook.
