# Build-time guard for the vendored container boot artifacts.
#
# `Resources/container-{image,kernel,initfs}/` are gitignored and populated by
# scripts/vendor-container-image.sh (image) and scripts/vendor-container-kernel.sh
# (kernel + initfs). They ship into the app via SwiftPM `.copy()` resources on
# AnglesiteContainer, so an unvendored tree (fresh clone, new worktree, git clean)
# still BUILDS fine — the app only fails at runtime, when preview reports
# "imageLayoutNotProvisioned; kernelNotProvisioned; initfsNotProvisioned"
# (BundledImage.swift). This script surfaces that gap at build time instead.
#
# The checks mirror BundledImage.swift's provisioning markers exactly — the dirs
# always exist (each keeps a committed .gitkeep so the `.copy()` rule never
# breaks), so presence of the real artifact files is what "provisioned" means:
#   container-image/index.json    (OCI layout — vendor-container-image.sh)
#   container-kernel/vmlinux      (kernel binary — vendor-container-kernel.sh)
#   container-initfs/index.json   (vminit OCI layout — vendor-container-kernel.sh)
#
# Beyond presence, the kernel/initfs (not the locally-built image — #616 scope) are also
# digest-checked against scripts/container-artifact-versions.lock.json: a present-but-wrong
# artifact (stale cache, corrupted download, tampered override) is exactly the failure presence
# checks alone can't catch. An entry with no pin recorded yet (lock value "null") is never
# treated as an error here — only a lock/artifact *mismatch* is, at the same Debug-warn/
# Release-error severity as a missing file below. This also settles #616's open question on env
# overrides in Release: they stay allowed, but a Release build now digest-checks the *overridden*
# path too, same severity as the default path — a stale/wrong override fails Release exactly like
# a stale/wrong vendored artifact would.
#
# Policy: Debug builds WARN (Xcode issue-navigator warnings, build continues) —
# a fresh worktree must stay buildable for work that never boots a container.
# Release builds FAIL — an archive without boot artifacts ships an app whose
# local-container preview can never work, and nothing downstream would catch it.
# Set ANGLESITE_ALLOW_UNPROVISIONED_CONTAINER=1 to downgrade a Release failure
# to a warning (e.g. exercising the Release configuration without vendoring).
#
# Lines prefixed `warning:` / `error:` are parsed by Xcode into real build issues.
