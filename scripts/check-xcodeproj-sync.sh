# Guards against project.yml ↔ source-tree drift for the gitignored Anglesite.xcodeproj.
#
# Anglesite.xcodeproj/ is regenerated from project.yml via XcodeGen and never committed,
# so a stale or malformed spec never fails `swift build` CI — it only surfaces later as
# `error: cannot find 'X' in scope` from `xcodebuild` on a contributor's machine (#123).
#
# This check regenerates the project, then asserts that every application target actually
# *compiles* every Swift file under Sources/AnglesiteApp. It catches the drift modes CI can
# see on a fresh generate:
#   1. A malformed/typo'd path in project.yml — XcodeGen exits non-zero on spec validation.
#   2. A narrowed/removed `sources:` entry that silently drops files from a target's compile
#      phase — XcodeGen exits 0, but the dropped files are then absent from that target's
#      Sources build phase (this script fails, naming the target and files).
#
# Membership is checked per application target (via the target's PBXSourcesBuildPhase), not by mere
# presence of a file reference. Files are compared by their path *relative to*
# Sources/AnglesiteApp (reconstructed from the PBX group hierarchy), not by bare basename, so two
# same-named files in different subdirs (e.g. Views/Settings.swift vs Overlays/Settings.swift) are
# distinguished.
#
# It deliberately does NOT run a full `xcodebuild` of the app: the app target needs the
# macOS 27 SDK (Xcode 27), which CI runners don't yet ship (see #128). XcodeGen only needs
# the spec + sources, so this guard runs anywhere xcodegen + python3 + plutil are installed.
# `plutil` (used below to convert the pbxproj plist to JSON) is macOS-only, so in practice
# this script requires macOS.
#
# XcodeGen version: CI pins 2.45.4 (see .github/workflows/ci.yml). This script requires at
# least the MIN_XCODEGEN below; the project graph keys it reads (PBXSourcesBuildPhase,
# productType, --quiet) are stable across the 2.x line.
